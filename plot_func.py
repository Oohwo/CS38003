# Write a function called plot_func() that uses matplotlib.pyplot.plot to produce a plot of the functions
# f(t) = sin(Ï€/t) when t != 0. If t = 0, f(0) = 0.
# g(t) = t*exp{-t^2}
# over the interval [-1.0, 1.0].
# Include labels for the x- and y-axes, and a legend.
# * x-label: "t-axes"
# * y-label: "y-axes"
# * Legend
#     * f(t)
#     * g(t)
# Make sure to use enough points that the curve is closed and appears smooth.
# Note: This part will be manually graded!
